Overview
--------

.. What is on this page?

In this guide, we show you how to set up and configure **monitoring** in the
MongoDB Java driver.

.. What do any new terms mean?

Monitoring is the process of getting runtime information about the MongoDB
Java driver for your application or an application performance
management library. Monitoring helps you understand your driver's resource
usage and performance, and can help you make informed decisions when designing
your application.    

.. What can you expect to see on this page?

On this page you can learn how to:

- Monitor different types of events in the MongoDB Java Driver
- Remotely monitor connection pool events

.. Who should read this? Where should I go if this isn't the page I was looking for?

If you like to learn how to record events in the MongoDB Java driver
rather than use realtime information about the driver in code, consider reading
our :doc:`guide on Logging </fundamentals/logging>`.
