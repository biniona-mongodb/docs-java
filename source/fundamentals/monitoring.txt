Overview
--------

.. What is on this page?

In this guide, we show you how to set up and configure **monitoring** in the
MongoDB Java driver.

.. What do any new terms mean?

Monitoring is the process of getting runtime information about the MongoDB
Java driver for your application or an application performance
management library. Monitoring helps you understand your driver's resource
usage and performance, and can help you make informed decisions when designing
and debugging your application.    

.. What can you expect to see on this page?

On this page you will learn how to:

- Monitor different types of events in the MongoDB Java Driver
- Remotely monitor connection pool events

.. Who should read this? Where should I go if this isn't the page I was looking for?

If you would like to learn how to record events in the MongoDB Java driver
rather than use realtime information about the driver in code, consider reading
our :doc:`guide on Logging </fundamentals/logging>`.

Monitor Events
--------------

The MongoDB Java driver organizes events into three categories:

- Command Events
- Cluster Events
- Connection Pool Events

The following sections show how to monitor each event category.

For a full list of the events you can monitor in the MongoDB Java driver,
:java-docs:`see the event package of the MongoDB Java Driver <apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/event/package-summary.html>`.

Command Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A command event is an event related to a MongoDB database command. Here are some
examples of database commands:

- ``find``
- ``insert``
- ``delete``
- ``count`` 

To monitor command events, you must write a class that implements the
``CommandListener`` interface and register an instance of that class with your
``MongoClient`` instance.

For more information on MongoDB database commands, see the
:manual:`MongoDB manual entry on database commands <reference/command/>`.

.. note:: Redacted Output

   As a security measure, the driver is unable to monitor some commands. This
   is to protect the sensitive information contained in the output of these
   commands. For a full list of commands the driver can't monitor,
   see the 
   :spec:`MongoDB command monitoring specification </command-monitoring/command-monitoring.rst#security>`.

Example
^^^^^^^

In this example we make a timer for database commands. When the driver
executes a database command on our MongoDB instance, the example code makes the
driver print the time it took to execute the command.

To make a timer, we must do the following:

- Make a class with timer functionality that implements the ``CommandListener`` interface.
- Add an instance of the class to a ``MongoSettings`` object.
- Configure our ``MongoClient`` instance with the ``MongoSettings`` object.

The following code defines the ``CommandTimer`` class which implements the
``CommandListener`` interface:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Monitoring.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start command-listener-impl
   :end-before: end command-listener-impl

The following code adds an instance of the ``CommandTimer`` class to a
``MongoSettings`` object, and configures a ``MongoClient`` instance with the
``MongoSettings`` object. The code then runs some database commands to test the
timer.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Monitoring.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start monitor-command-example
   :end-before: end monitor-command-example

The above code snippet should produce output that looks like this:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Command 'find' took 22 milliseconds
   Command 'aggregate' took 15 milliseconds
   Command 'distinct' took 15 milliseconds
