Set Up Logging
--------------

The MongoDB Java Driver uses the Simple Logging Facade For Java (SLF4J) API for
logging. SLF4J allows you to specify your logging framework of choice at
deployment time. For more information on SLF4J, 
`see the SLF4J documentation <http://www.slf4j.org/>`__.

To set up logging, add SLF4J to your project's dependency list. SLF4J requires a
**binding**. A binding in this case refers to the logging framework you would like
to use when logging messages from the MongoDB Java Driver. Some popular logging
frameworks to use as a binding are ``Log4J2``, ``Logback``, and
``java.util.logging``.
